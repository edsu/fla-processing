This directory contains scripts for normalizing and massaging the 
orginal FLA spreadsheets and scan data that were given to MITH using
Box in April 2015. The original spreadsheets were created by multiple
people and needed to be normalized before further processing can be done.

The original spreadsheets from Box are included in the spreadsheets
directory. The Makefile included shows the entire workflow.
